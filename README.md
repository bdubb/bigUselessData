Although the ISPs announced that they are not going to sell their users data as a result of the FCC rolling back regulations, it might be fun to have a browser automate random web suring.

Have fun watching and maybe make your web browsing data less valuable? #resist

## Synopsis

This is a python script that will pop open a chrome browser and start surfing the web.

I used selenium to automate the browser activity.

## Motivation

It might be nice to have some extra, random traffic showing up in your traffic history, just in case the ISPs or others wanted to get some insights into what you looked at online.

## Installation

Requires selenium, random, time and urllib2 libraries

If you wanted to make this better - you would extend the time the browser waits on a page. I shortened it, because it's more fun to watch and test with a shorter time between clicks.
